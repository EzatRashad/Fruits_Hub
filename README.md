## 🏗️ Project Structure  

The project follows a **clean and scalable architecture**, keeping separation of concerns in mind:  
lib/
# Project Structure (`lib/`)

The `lib/` directory contains the core application code, organized into a modular structure for better maintainability and scalability. Below is the detailed breakdown of the folder structure:

## Description of Each Folder

### `Core/`
This folder contains the core functionality and shared resources used across the application.

- **`services/`**: Houses services like `StorageService`, API handlers, and other business logic services.
- **`assets/`**: Stores app-wide constants such as colors, text styles, and other reusable assets.
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions, helper classes, and extensions that are used throughout the app.

### `Features/`
This folder follows a feature-based modular architecture, where each feature is self-contained and organized into layers.

- **`Screen/`**: Contains app screen and UI elements.
  - **`Data/`**: Represents the data layer of the app.
    - **`model/`**: Contains data models (e.g., `FruitModel`) that represent the structure of the data.
    - **`repo/`**: Implements the repository pattern to manage data sources (e.g., local database, API).
  - **`Presentation/`**: Represents the UI layer of the app.
    - **`view/`**: Contains the screens and layouts for the app.
      - **`widgets/`**: Houses reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, lists).
     - **`cubit/`**: Manages the state of the app using the Cubit state management pattern.

---

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and scale. Each feature is modular, allowing for independent development and testing.
